2 Timothy 3:2–4
“men shall be lovers of their own selves…lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.”

I urge you to discern through the Spirit your divinely given capacities.

Use Correct Principles
Establish a set of guiding principles for your life from the teachings of Jesus Christ. Never compromise them. Difficulties in life begin when small deviations from true principles are made to justify a quick move to greater accomplishment. Over time, that pattern brings failure. Strength comes from making no exceptions to guiding principles.

Success Is Gauged by Self-Mastery
President N. Eldon Tanner
First Counselor in the First Presidency

Solomon in all his wisdom made this meaningful statement: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” (Prov. 16:32.)
There are two important elements in self-mastery. The first is to determine your course or set the sails, so to speak, of moral standards; the other is the willpower, or the wind in the sails carrying one forward. As I said before, character is determined by the extent to which we can master ourselves toward good ends.
