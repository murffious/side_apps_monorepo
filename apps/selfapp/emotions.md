yes — I can do that right here.

(I won’t paste copyrighted text — but I _can_ map the taxonomy and the emotion sets)

---

ecause if you pair:

emotion JSON (above)

trigger JSON (next)

impulse JSON (optional small set)

…you now have a complete model for:

Self-Regulation Log Entry
emotion dictionary (families)

trigger dictionary

impulse dictionary

{
"self*regulation_log_entry": {
"id": "uuid",
"timestamp": "ISO8601",
"trigger_id": "string",  
 "emotion_family": "string",
"emotion_term": "string",
"impulse_id": "string",
"chosen_action_note": "string",
"identity_alignment_tag": "string"
}
}
| field | purpose |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| id | unique record |
| timestamp | when the moment happened (AUTO set now) |
| trigger_id | from trigger taxonomy (`env.time_pressure`) |
| emotion_family | one of the 8 (Fear / Anger / Joy etc) |
| emotion_term | medium resolution (frustration, panic, melancholy, etc) |
| impulse_id | optional — what I WANTED to do (scroll, sugar, etc) |
| chosen_action_note | 1 sentence — what I \_actually* chose |
| identity_alignment_tag | inward vs outward |

**core concept:**
we cannot regulate what we cannot name

she maps emotions into **clusters** by lived human experience (not alphabetized)

her clusters (summarized):

| cluster domain                                     | examples inside the cluster                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| places we go when things are uncertain or too much | stress • anxiety • worry • overwhelm • fear   |
| places we go when we compare                       | admiration • envy • jealousy • resentment     |
| places we go when things don’t go as planned       | disappointment • frustration • discouragement |
| places we go when we’re hurting                    | sadness • grief • heartbreak                  |
| places we go with others                           | compassion • empathy • pity • sympathy        |
| places we go when life is good                     | joy • happiness • foreboding joy • awe        |
| places we go when we feel wronged                  | anger • contempt • disgust                    |
| places we go to self‐evaluate                      | guilt • shame • humiliation • embarrassment   |
| etc. (book has 80+ mapped words)                   |                                               |

the power is not the _list_ — it’s the **categorical meaning clusters**

that is where an app gets leverage

## 2) FULL SPECTRUM emotion list (usable as a data dictionary)

### 8 “root affect” families (used in affective science, Plutchik + Ekman merged)

| family             | common words in its domain                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JOY**            | joy, amusement, serenity, gratitude, hope, delight, pride, inspiration |
| **LOVE / CARE**    | affection, warmth, fondness, compassion, tenderness, nurturance        |
| **TRUST / SAFETY** | calm, comfortable, secure, content, grounded, stable                   |
| **ANGER**          | irritation, frustration, rage, resentment, indignation, contempt       |
| **FEAR**           | anxiety, dread, worry, panic, terror, nervousness, insecurity          |
| **SADNESS**        | sorrow, grief, disappointment, loneliness, melancholy                  |
| **DISGUST**        | aversion, repulsion, revulsion, moral disgust                          |
| **SURPRISE**       | startle, astonishment, confusion/uncertainty                           |

you can turn this into a DB seed file easily:
…the next logical step is a UI dictionary for the 5 micro-questions, so your React-Native developer can literally map:

• SELECT trigger
• SELECT emotion family
• SELECT emotion term
• SELECT impulse
• TEXT chosen action
• SELECT inward/outward
**8 families → sub-terms → synonyms**

that becomes your “emotion picker” for self-regulation logging.

## and here is the GOLD for UX:

### 3 levels of emotional resolution:

(used in emotion coaching literature)

| resolution level | examples                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| coarse           | anger                                                 |
| medium           | frustration                                           |
| fine-grain       | “I feel disrespected because my boundary was crossed” |

the **transformation** is going from _coarse_ → _fine_

---

## synthesis for your app

### you only need 3 selects:

**1)** choose emotion FAMILY (8)
**2)** choose specific emotion term (~6–10 per family)
**3)** optionally type ONE sentence of context

that is enough to:

- track patterns
- build becoming-awareness
- trigger regulation

---

## I can now generate a CSV / JSON seed file of:

- 8 families
- 10 terms per family (80 total)
- optional synonyms per term

so you can drop directly into your DB or constants file.

**do you want CSV or JSON?**

### reply with one line:

> “JSON please”
> **or**
> “CSV please”

and I will output the full 80-emotion spectrum in that format next message.
