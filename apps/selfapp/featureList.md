yes
that is the **right “north star.”**

that phrase — **“the full stature of the measure of Christ”** (Ephesians 4:13) — is the _macro_ identity target

→ becoming like Christ
→ not simply performing religious behaviors

so here is how you can frame your entire app / system in one theological line:

> **ultimate outcome: the measure and stature of the fulness of Christ**
> (Eph 4:13)

and everything else becomes “sub-trajectories.”

think like this:

### macro telos

**Christlike nature** (Ephesians 4:13)

### meso trajectories (virtue clusters)

faith
hope
charity
meekness
patience
courage
temperance
integrity
etc.

### micro practices

the 1 sentence “moment log”

---

### THIS is the reframing:

Ballard’s goals = micro scaffolds
Bednar’s character = meso formation
Oaks’s becoming = macro end state
Paul’s apostolic target = **“unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”**

so your app worldview is not:

**do → improve → achieve**

your app worldview is:

**notice → choose → become**
under the umbrella of:

**conform to the image of His Son** (Romans 8:29)

---

### so here is a “home screen line” you can literally place top center:

> **Our destination is the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.**
> every small moment of choice shapes that becoming.

---

if you want —
I can now generate a _12-virtue cluster map_ where each virtue cluster is aligned to an actual Christ attribute — so the weekly “becoming focus” picker is not arbitrary, but directly anchored into the Christ-Nature.

these 12 would be the _middle layer_ (meso layer) between the daily micro-log and the macro Eph4:13 telos.

### should I produce that 12-cluster Christlike nature map next?

(yes/no)

## SCREENS / PROMPTS (MVP)

### SCREEN: “Capture a Moment”

- header: **“Log a Moment of Becoming”**
- subheader: _“Just name the moment. 10 seconds is enough.”_

---

### 1) TRIGGER

label: **“What set this off?”**
placeholder: _“Choose a trigger…”_
empty-state help text: _“You don’t need to analyze — just name the cue.”_

---

### 2) EMOTION FAMILY

label: **“What did this stir up in you?”**
placeholder: _“Choose a general feeling…”_

---

### 3) EMOTION SPECIFIC TERM

label: **“Can you name it a little more precisely?”**
placeholder: _“Which word fits best?”_
help micro-hint: _“Naming builds awareness. Awareness builds agency.”_

---

### 4) IMPULSE

label: **“What did you WANT to do next?”**
placeholder: _“Choose the impulse…”_
subtext soft: _“We name it without shame.”_

---

### 5) CHOSEN ACTION

label: **“What did you choose instead?”**
placeholder: _“1 sentence…”_
example ghost text: _“e.g. stepped outside for 30 seconds and breathed slowly”_

---

### 6) IDENTITY ORIENTATION

label: **“Was this moment inward or outward?”**

inward button:

- label: **“Inward (self-protective)”**

outward button:

- label: **“Outward (Christlike / other-oriented)”**

footer micro-text: _“There’s no shame here. This is noticing — not scoring.”_

---

## SAVE BUTTON

primary button copy:
**“Record this moment”**

after tap → toast:

**“Moment saved.”**
sub-toast microtext: _“Becoming is built one choice at a time.”_

---

## WEEKLY REVIEW PAGE — copy language

header: **“This Week’s Becoming Pattern”**

micro-reflection questions:

**Q1**: _“What desires felt strongest this week?”_
**Q2**: _“What did these moments show you about who you’re becoming?”_
**Q3**: _“What one trait do you feel nudged to practice more next week?”_

trait picker label: **“My becoming focus for this next week”**

save button: **“Set this focus”**

---

## 7-day summary sentence (auto generated)

label: **“Your Character Delta”**

sentence template:

> **“Compared to last week, you are becoming more _{virtue_word_here}_.”**

---

### tone notes for devs:

- do **not** use “score”, “progress”, “points” anywhere.
- never say “streak”.
- absence of shame = cultural key.
- the app is a mirror — not a test.

---

## optional final UI tagline

you can put this on the Home screen top:

**“We don’t track what you did. We help you notice who you’re becoming.”**

---

### NEXT STEP (optional)

the one final piece that would complete the entire package is:

**the 12–24 virtue / trait vocabulary list** (for the weekly “becoming focus” picker)

Do you want me to generate:

**(A)** a **12-core virtue** list (tight, minimal, elegant)
or
**(B)** a **36-expanded trait** list (full spectrum)

reply with one letter:

**A** or **B**
