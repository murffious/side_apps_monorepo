		text: `My dear brothers and sisters, I greet you with love and appreciation for your faith and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nThe most important event in the history of the world—past, present, and future—is the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The reality of the Savior's return to the earth is certain. It is sure. It is definite.\n\nThe prophets of all dispensations have testified of this momentous event. The scriptures are replete with declarations and descriptions of the Second Coming. Jesus Himself taught His Apostles, "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."\n\nThe exact time of His coming is not known. The Savior declared: "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only." Though we do not know when He will come, we know He will come. And we know why He will come.\n\nHe will come to cleanse the earth. He will come to judge all mankind. He will come to reward the righteous and to punish the wicked. He will come to rule and reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\n\nHow can we prepare for His coming? We prepare by developing an unshakable faith in Jesus Christ. We prepare by making and keeping sacred covenants. We prepare by staying on the covenant path. We prepare by enduring faithfully to the end.\n\nI bear my solemn witness that Jesus Christ will return to the earth. I testify that He lives. He is our Savior and our Redeemer. May we prepare ourselves and our families for His glorious return.`,

It is a blessing we can seek through prayer and righteous living. The Savior exemplified this love perfectly in His mortal ministry and in His infinite Atonement.\n\nWe can develop charity by following the Savior's example. We can serve others without thought of reward. We can forgive those who have wronged us. We can reach out to those who are different from us. We can love even our enemies.\n\nAs we strive to develop charity, we become more like our Heavenly Father and His Son. We find greater joy and peace. We bless the lives of those around us. We prepare ourselves for eternal life.\n\nI testify that the pure love of Christ can change our hearts and our lives. May we seek this precious gift and share it generously with all of God's children.`,

For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"\n\nDiscipleship requires sacrifice. It requires obedience. It requires putting aside worldly desires and focusing on eternal priorities. The path of discipleship is not always easy, but it is always worth it.\n\nWhen we follow Christ, we may face ridicule from the world. We may be called to give up things we hold dear. We may experience trials and challenges that test our faith. But in return, we receive blessings beyond measure.\n\nThe blessings of discipleship include peace that surpasses understanding, joy in the midst of sorrow, strength to overcome trials, and the promise of eternal life. We gain the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We develop Christlike attributes. We build relationships that last forever.\n\nThe cost of discipleship is great, but the blessings are infinitely greater. I testify that Jesus Christ is worth every sacrifice we make. He is worth our whole hearts, our whole souls, our whole lives.\n\nMay we count the cost and choose discipleship, knowing that in Him, we find everything we truly need.`,

We were excited to come here. We knew that mortality would be challenging, but we also knew it would be an incredible adventure—an opportunity to learn, grow, and become more like our Heavenly Father.\n\nMortality is not a punishment. It is a blessing. It is a gift. The scriptures teach us that "men are, that they might have joy." This doesn't mean we won't face trials, but it does mean that joy is possible even in the midst of difficulty.\n\nThe adventure of mortality includes experiencing the full range of human emotions—joy and sorrow, love and loss, triumph and failure. It includes making choices that shape our eternal destiny. It includes forming relationships that can last forever.\n\nAs we navigate this mortal adventure, we can find joy in simple things—the beauty of nature, the laughter of children, the kindness of friends. We can find purpose in serving others and building the kingdom of God. We can find strength in the Savior's Atonement.\n\nI testify that this mortal adventure, though challenging, is worth it. Every experience, every trial, every joy contributes to our eternal growth. May we embrace this adventure with faith, hope, and love.`,

They are not coincidences. They are personal, specific blessings from a loving Heavenly Father who knows us individually and cares about the details of our lives.\n\nI have seen tender mercies in my own life—times when just the right person said just the right thing at just the right moment. Times when unexpected help came exactly when it was needed. Times when peace and comfort descended when circumstances seemed overwhelming.\n\nTender mercies come in many forms. Sometimes they are dramatic interventions. More often, they are quiet promptings, small coincidences, or gentle feelings of peace and reassurance.\n\nTo receive tender mercies, we must be faithful. We must be watchful. We must recognize the Lord's hand in our lives. We must express gratitude for the blessings we receive.\n\nI testify that the Lord's tender mercies are real. They are available to all who seek them in faith. May we open our eyes to see them and our hearts to receive them.`,

		text: `Today I wish to speak about the importance of adjusting our priorities in these latter days.\n\nThe Savior taught: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." This simple principle can guide us in setting our priorities.\n\nIn today's busy world, we face countless demands on our time and attention. Work, family, church service, education, recreation—all compete for our limited hours. Without clear priorities, we can easily become overwhelmed and lose focus on what matters most.\n\nWhat should our priorities be? First, our relationship with God through prayer, scripture study, and worship. Second, our families—our spouses, children, and extended family. Third, our service to others and building the kingdom of God.\n\nAdjusting our priorities often means saying no to good things so we can say yes to the best things. It means turning off devices and turning toward people. It means simplifying our lives and focusing on what brings lasting joy.\n\nThe scriptures remind us that "by small and simple things are great things brought to pass." Daily acts of devotion, consistent family time, and regular service may seem small, but they yield great eternal rewards.\n\nI challenge each of us to prayerfully evaluate our priorities and make necessary adjustments. May we put first things first.`,

Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."\n\nThe peace of Christ is different from worldly peace. Worldly peace depends on circumstances—health, prosperity, favorable conditions. The peace of Christ transcends circumstances. It can be present even in the midst of trials, sorrow, and uncertainty.\n\nHow do we access this peace? We access it through faith in Jesus Christ. We access it through repentance and forgiveness. We access it through keeping the commandments and honoring our covenants. We access it through trust in God's plan.\n\nI have felt the peace of Christ in dark moments of my life. When facing seemingly impossible challenges, I have felt a calm assurance that everything would be all right. When grieving losses, I have felt comfort that only the Savior can provide.\n\nThis peace is one of the greatest gifts we can receive in mortality. It anchors us when storms rage. It lifts us when burdens weigh us down. It reminds us that we are not alone.\n\nI testify that the peace of Christ is real and available to each of us. May we seek it diligently and share it generously with others who are struggling.`,

Sometimes the voice is clear and unmistakable. More often, it is subtle and easily missed if we are not paying attention.\n\nRecognizing promptings requires practice. We must learn to distinguish the Spirit's voice from our own thoughts, from the influence of others, and from the temptations of the adversary. This discernment comes through experience and through studying the scriptures.\n\nWhen we receive a prompting, we should act on it quickly. Promptings often come with urgency. Delay can result in lost opportunities to serve, to help, or to receive needed guidance.\n\nI have learned that promptings are often about simple things—calling a friend, helping a neighbor, reading a specific scripture, or attending a meeting. These small promptings, when followed, lead to significant blessings.\n\nThe Spirit will guide us in all aspects of our lives if we are willing to listen and obey. I testify that personal revelation is available to every member of the Church. May we cultivate our ability to receive and follow promptings.`,

The scriptures teach that "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."\n\nOur faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of everything we do in the Church. It motivates us to repent, to be baptized, to receive the Holy Ghost, and to endure to the end. Without faith, none of these other principles and ordinances have power in our lives.\n\nFaith begins with a desire to believe. Alma taught that even "if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you." From this small beginning, faith can grow into a perfect knowledge.\n\nWe develop faith by hearing the word of God, by studying the scriptures, by praying, and by acting on the truth we receive. Each time we exercise faith, it grows stronger. Each time we doubt and fail to act, it weakens.\n\nFaith is not passive. It requires effort, sacrifice, and persistence. It requires us to trust God even when we don't understand His purposes. It requires us to move forward even when the path is unclear.\n\nI testify that Jesus Christ lives. He is the Son of God, our Savior and Redeemer. Faith in Him has power to change our lives, to heal our hearts, and to lead us back to our Heavenly Father. May we nurture and strengthen our faith every day.`,

It begins with faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. We enter the path through the ordinance of baptism and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. We stay on the path by partaking of the sacrament, receiving temple ordinances, and keeping our covenants.\n\nCovenants are two-way promises between us and God. We promise to keep His commandments, to take upon us the name of Christ, to serve others, and to build His kingdom. He promises to bless us with guidance, strength, protection, and ultimately eternal life.\n\nThe temple is central to the covenant path. In the temple, we receive sacred ordinances that bind us to God and to each other for eternity. Temple covenants give us power to overcome the world and access to the highest blessings of the Atonement.\n\nStaying on the covenant path requires daily effort. We must pray, study the scriptures, serve others, and attend church. We must resist temptation and repent quickly when we fall short. We must endure faithfully to the end.\n\nThe covenant path is not always easy, but it is always worth it. On this path, we find true joy, lasting peace, and eternal purpose. On this path, we become who God created us to be.\n\nI testify that the covenant path leads to eternal life. May we commit to staying on this path no matter what challenges we face.",
